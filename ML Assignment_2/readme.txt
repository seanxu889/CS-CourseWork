[CS 613 - Machine Learning Assignment 2]: Logistic Regression(Closed Form), S-Folds Cross-Validation, Locally-Weighted Linear Regression

Name: Shaoshu Xu

=================================================================

The zip file contains for parts: A LaTeX typeset PDF, Matlab Source Code files, readme file. There are four .m files in the Source Code folder.

hw2_2.m: 
Run the code directly and it will output the final model weight and root mean squared error.

hw2_3.m: 
First change the value of S (S=3,5,20,N) and run the code, it will output the mean & standard deviation of the RMSE for S over the 20 different seed values.

hw2_4.m: 
Run the code directly and it will output the root mean squared error.

hw2_5.m: 
Run the code directly and it will output the final model weight, final RMSE testing error, final RMSE training error and the graph.

=================================================================

Environment:

Matlab r2018a 64-bit.

=================================================================

Additional: If you have any questions about the files or compile problem when running on Drexel tux, please feel free to email me. [sx66@drexel.edu]
