Name: Shaoshu Xu

Naive_Bayes_Classifier.py: 
Python3 source code of Naive Bayes Classifier.

Naive_Bayes_Classifier_Best.py: 
Python3 source code of Naive Bayes-Best Classifier.

2classifier_evaluate.py: 
You will define which classifier will do the classification. The variable “testFile” can be either “Naive_Bayes_Classifier.py” or “Naive_Bayes_Classifier_Best.py”. 
This file returns the asked measures when the labels are provided, with testDir = "movies_reviews/“. And returns the predicted classes for the unknown test files in “MyTestFolder”.

Evaluate Your System.docx:
The document including my answers to the reflection question, an explanation of the features I used to improve my system, and my evaluation.

Compilation & Execution Instructions: 
Testing on files which can extract their labels from their titles and report the required measures, using the command “python 2classifier_evaluate.py”. In this case, the test folder directory is the value assigned to “testDir” variable in line 12 of the code.
The other scenario is testing on files which don’t have labels, and they are all located in a folder, which is passed by command line argument “python 2classifier_evaluate.py MyTestFolder”.

Additional: 
I write code using Python 3.
Please make sure all the documents are under the correct path and you have permission to execute the files.
If you have any other questions about the files or compile problem, please feel free to email me. [sx66@drexel.edu]
