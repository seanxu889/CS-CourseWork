[CS510 2018 Fall Quarter HW1]: Sliding Brick Puzzle(BFS,DFS,IDS,A*)

Name: Shaoshu Xu

test_all.py: Python source code. I write code using Python3, but it seems there is only Python2 on tux, so I changed some output sentences make sure it can run on tux correctly. (If there still are some compile problems about Python2 or 3, I can provide the Python3 source code, I think it would print a totally correctly output.)

hw1.sh: Bash script for use on tux. 

Running: Please make sure you have permission to execute the files by using “chmod u+x hw1.sh”. The path of test-files SBP-level.txt can be changed in line 405 and 406.

output-hw1.txt: Generate on tux using “./hw1.sh > output-hw1.txt”.
	
Additional: If you have any other questions about the files or compile problem, please feel free to email me. [sx66@drexel.edu]

Thank you!
