[CS 613 - Machine Learning Assignment 1]: PCA, K-Means

Name: Shaoshu Xu

=================================================================

The zip file contains for parts: A LaTeX typeset PDF, Matlab Source Code files, readme file, Sample videos. There are seven .m files in the Source Code folder.

hw1_1_1.m: 
Run the code directly and it will output the results for Theory Question 1.1.

hw1_1_2.m: 
Run the code directly and it will output the results for Theory Question 1.2.

hw1_2.m: 
The dataset and the .m file should in the same working directory, or you could set the dataset directory at the beginning of the code. Run the code and it will output the visualization of the PCA result.

hw1_3.m: 
The dataset and the .m file should in the same working directory, or you could set the dataset directory at the beginning of the code. Run the code and it will output the visualization of the reconstruction of the first person.

hw1_4.m: 
The dataset and the .m file should in the same working directory, or you could set the dataset directory at the beginning of the code. Run the code and it will call the “myKMeans” function to implement clustering.

myKMeans.m: This is the main function, it will determine the dimension of the data and call the “doKMeans” function.

doKMeans.m: This function will do the clustering and plot the results. Due to the color matrix’s size (7*3), the max k is seven. If you want to implement the clustering with more than seven cluster, you can enlarge the color matrix to more rows. It will represent more colors.

=================================================================

Environment:

Matlab r2018a 64-bit.
