=================================================================

The zip file contains for parts: A LaTeX typeset PDF, Matlab Source Code files, readme file. There are eight .m files in the Source Code folder.

[hw3_2.m] 
Running the script and it will output the Precision, Recall, F-measure, Accuracy. This script only works for binary-class dataset. The multi-class version of Naive Bayes Classiﬁer is in hw3_4_NaiveBayes.m.

[hw3_3.m]
The script will call two functions: id3Tree and id3TreeClassify. Running the script and it will output the Precision, Recall, F-measure, Accuracy. This script only works for binary-class dataset. The multi-class version of Decision Trees is in hw3_4_DecisionTree.m.

[id3Tree.m]
This function trains and constructs a decision tree using the ID3 algorithm. This is a binary-class version.

[id3TreeClassify.m]
This function classifies data by given decision tree. This is a binary-class version.

[hw3_4_NaiveBayes.m]
Running the script and it will output the Accuracy. This script works for the three-class dataset.

[hw3_4_DecisionTree.m]
The script will call two functions: id3Tree_multi and id3TreeClassify_multi. Running the script and it will output the Accuracy. This script works for the three-class dataset.

[id3Tree_multi.m]
This function trains and constructs a decision tree using the ID3 algorithm. This function works for the three-class dataset.

[id3TreeClassify_multi.m]
This function classifies data by given decision tree. This function works for the three-class dataset.
